# JS-Game-Project
First milestone project for NORCS-12 web game build

# Cat ATTACK


# # Description

_This is a game clearly inspired by the many survive the night style games like five nights at freddyâ€™s, slenderman, boogyman ect. 
I personally love a horror game especially a comically bad one so knowing I had limited coding knowledge I knew I could create something fun, potentially comically unscary. So here it is!_

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://github.com/millsh56/JS-Game-Project.git


# # Game Logic

```
Oh no! looks like you are trapped in the cat cafe!! You'll have to survive the night and keep the cats at bay until daylight.
There are three doors with cats at each door. You must click on the cats to feed each cat when it meows. or something of the sort...
if you do not feed the cat it gets red and angry and at a certain point will attack 

three attacks resutls in a loss

surviving for a set time results in a win!

in the works! but





### Post-MVP Plans

One cool idea I have: Fast playing almost jumpscare images hehe but of my cat freddie because he can get you
One that will be a stretch: uhh any audio because I have no idea.. and functionality in general, really streching skills..
Something else I dont technically know how to do *yet*:
oh so much, sort of its all doing it in practice now. 

audio meows for each cat
