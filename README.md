# JS-Game-Project
First milestone project for NORCS-12 web game build

# Cat ATTACK


# # Description

_This is a game clearly inspired by the many survive the night style games like five nights at freddyâ€™s, slenderman, boogyman ect. 
I personally love a horror game especially a comically bad one so knowing I had limited coding knowledge I knew I could create something fun, potentially comically unscary. So here it is!_

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://github.com/millsh56/JS-Game-Project.git


# # Game Logic

```
trapped in the cat cafe, there are three doors with cats at each you must push a button to feed each cat when it meows. or something of the sort...
if you do not feed the cat it gets red and angry and at a certain point will attack 
three attacks resutls in a loss

surviving for a set time results in a win!

in the works! but

The control panel enables the player to feed angry cats, one at a time. There are three buttons on the panel. One for each cat. 



### Post-MVP Plans

One cool idea I have: Fast playing almost jumpscare images hehe but of my cat freddie because he can get you
One that will be a stretch: uhh any audio because I have no idea.. and functionality in general, really streching skills..
Something else I dont technically know how to do *yet*:
oh so much, sort of its all doing it in practice now.
