        <p>Oh no! Looks like you got stuck in the cat cafe after dark! Are those cats watching you? They sure are, looks like someone forgot to feed them... </p>
    <p>Dear Player,</p>
    <p>I was once trapped in here like you. If you follow my advice you should make it out just fine. Be cautious, these cats mean business.</p>
    <p>When each cat meows click it to give it a treat. This will calm it down... Until it get's hungry again.</p>
    <p>Lookout for Hangry cats. Once they turn red and start to grow you don't have a lot of time before they lunge. If the cats get you three times before sunrise you might not live to see another day outside this place.</p>
    <p>I wish you better luck than me, it looks like this will be my last time at the cat cafe, at least for a long time.</p>
    <p>Good Luck!</p>
